      Hayao Miyazaki is a renowned Japanese animator, director, and co-founder of Studio Ghibli. Known for his beautifully hand-drawn animation and emotionally rich storytelling, Miyazaki has created iconic films such as 
      <strong>Spirited Away</strong>, <strong>My Neighbor Totoro</strong>, 
      <strong>Princess Mononoke</strong>, and <strong>Howl's Moving Castle</strong>. 
      His work often explores themes of <em>nature</em>, <em>pacifism</em>, and the 
      <em>innocence of childhood</em>, earning him a lasting legacy in global cinema.
